#### Lecture 2: Values, Variables, and Types
**Takeaways**
   - vals are immutable therefore cannot be reassigned
   - variables are mutable and can be reassigned
   - this reassignment is referred to as a side effect
   - types can be inferred
   - prefer vals over vars
   - all vals and vars have types
   - compiler automatically infers types when omitted
   - learned how to use basic types
     - Boolean
     - Int, Long, Double
     - String
